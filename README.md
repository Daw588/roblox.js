# About

Roblox.js is a modern open-source [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@daw588/roblox.js) that brings the official [Roblox Open Cloud](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/open-cloud) and few others things to JavaScript world with little learning curve. Roblox.js is designed to be as close as possible to [native Luau APIs](https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/api-reference) in terms of design, and therefore, making it very easy to transition to.
